# QuantumQueryComplexity_ICO
Code for the paper "Query Complexity of Boolean Functions under Indefinite Causal Order" by Alastair A. Abbott, Mehdi Mhalla and Pierre Pocreau

The Matlab project requires:
- [CVX](https://github.com/cvxr/CVX): a Matlab package for convex optimizaton. 
- [QETLab](https://qetlab.com/Main_Page): a Matlab toolbox for exploring quantum entanglement theory.
- qsuperop: a MATLAB code package for working with quantum superoperators and their causal structure.

The Matlab project is structured as follow:
